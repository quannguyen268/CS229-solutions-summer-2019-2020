\begin{answer}
We have:
\begin{align}
	D_{KL}(P\|Q)
	&= \mathbb{E}_{X \sim P} \left[ - \log \frac{Q(X)}{P(X)} \right] \\ 
	&\ge - \log \mathbb{E}_{X \sim P} \left[ \frac{Q(X)}{P(X)} \right] \\
	&= - \log \sum_x P(x) \frac{Q(x)}{P(x)} \\
	&= - \log \sum_x Q(x) \\
	&= - \log (1) \\
	&= 0
\end{align}
In line $(2)$, we applied the Jensen's inequality for the strictly convex function $- \log(\cdot)$. The inequality holds with equality  if and only if $\dfrac{Q(X)}{P(X)}$ is a constant almost surely. This implies that $\dfrac{Q(X)}{P(X)} = \text{ a constant}$ for $x \in$ the support of $X$, which implies $P = Q$. \\
