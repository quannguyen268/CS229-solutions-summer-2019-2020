\begin{answer}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The semi-supervised EM took much less iterations to converge, up to $291/24 \approx 12$ times.
\item The cluster assignments are more stable in the semi-supervised EM, as opposed to the unsupervised EM.
\item This dataset contains 3 low-variance Gaussian distributions which are closely replaced and a forth high-variance Gaussian distribution that overlaps with the first 3. Still, the semi-supervised EM could take advantage of additional information about the cluster identities of some examples to isolate clusters accurately.
\end{enumerate}
\end{answer}
