\begin{answer}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Modifying the selection scheme for learning rates doesn't change the 
	linear separability, hence the model wouldn't converge.
	\item Same answer as (i).
	\item Linear transformation doesn't remove the separability of dataset B, hence 
	the model still wouldn't converge.
	\item Regularization can help in this case. The cost function is modified and 
	might have a minimum now.
	\item Adding noise terms might break the separability and make the model converge. \\ 
	\end{enumerate}
