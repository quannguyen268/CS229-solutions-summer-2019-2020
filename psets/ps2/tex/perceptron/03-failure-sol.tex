\begin{answer}
The dot-product kernel tried to fit a linear decision boundary, this apparently didn't work well on our highly non-linear dataset. Meanwhile, the RBF kernel had an infinite dimensional feature map and was able to learn non-linear decision boundaries (figure 2(b)). Lastly, the not-a-kernel function failed to learn anything useful because it broke the logic of our algorithm. \\
